# Home-Task
Home Task for R&amp;D Engineer (Linux System Administrator) position:
### **CloudLinux 6 to CloudLinux 8 Upgrade Algorithm**

---

### **Preparation Phase**

#### 1. **Create Migration Task:**
   - Create the task to track and manage the migration process. Automate team notifications and task assignment.

   **Puppet Manifest:**
   ```puppet
   exec { 'notify_teams':
     command => '/usr/local/bin/send_migration_notification.sh',
     path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin',
     unless  => 'test -f /var/run/migration_notified',
   }
   ```

#### 2. **Notify Teams & Customers:**
   - Automatically notify the Product, Support, and other related teams.
   - Enable **cPanel banner** to notify customers about the upcoming migration.

   **Puppet Manifest:**
   ```puppet
   file { '/usr/local/cpanel/banner':
     ensure  => present,
     content => 'We will be upgrading our system to CloudLinux 8. Some services may be temporarily unavailable.',
   }

   exec { 'send_customer_notification':
     command => '/usr/local/bin/send_customer_notification.sh',
     path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin',
   }
   ```

#### 3. **Automated System Audit:**
   - Automate system health checks using Puppet to verify consistency and integrity of accounts, databases, and services.

   **Puppet Manifest:**
   ```puppet
   exec { 'check_system_integrity':
     command => '/usr/local/bin/system_check.sh',
     path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin',
   }
   ```

#### 4. **Backup & Snapshot Automation:**
   - Automate backups of all accounts and server configurations. Use Puppet to sync content from **/home, /usr, and /var** directories.

   **Puppet Manifest:**
   ```puppet
   exec { 'backup_data':
     command => 'rsync -av /home /backup/home && rsync -av /usr /backup/usr && rsync -av /var /backup/var',
     path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin',
   }

   exec { 'create_snapshot':
     command => '/usr/local/bin/create_snapshot.sh',
     path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin',
   }
   ```

#### 5. **Final Sync Before Migration:**
   - Perform a final sync of any changed data before the migration. Automate the process using **rsync**.

   **Puppet Manifest:**
   ```puppet
   exec { 'final_sync':
     command => 'rsync -av /home /backup/home --delete',
     path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin',
   }
   ```

---

### **Migration Phase**

#### 6. **Automate VM Snapshot Creation:**
   - Create snapshots of the VMs and volumes before the migration to ensure quick rollback if necessary.

   **Puppet Manifest:**
   ```puppet
   exec { 'create_vm_snapshot':
     command => '/usr/local/bin/create_vm_snapshot.sh',
     path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin',
   }
   ```

#### 7. **Boot from Live CD & Automate OS Upgrade:**
   - Use Puppet to automate the reboot from a **Live CD** and initiate the OS upgrade.

   **Puppet Manifest:**
   ```puppet
   exec { 'boot_from_live_cd':
     command => '/usr/local/bin/reboot_live_cd.sh',
     path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin',
   }

   exec { 'os_upgrade':
     command => '/usr/local/bin/upgrade_to_cl8.sh',
     path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin',
     require => Exec['boot_from_live_cd'],
   }
   ```

#### 8. **Restore Server Configurations:**
   - Automate restoration of server configurations such as **Apache, Litespeed, MariaDB**, and **PHP** after the upgrade.

   **Puppet Manifest:**
   ```puppet
   file { '/etc/apache2/apache2.conf':
     ensure  => present,
     source  => '/backup/configs/apache2.conf',
   }

   file { '/etc/mysql/my.cnf':
     ensure  => present,
     source  => '/backup/configs/my.cnf',
   }

   service { ['apache2', 'mysql']:
     ensure    => running,
     subscribe => File['/etc/apache2/apache2.conf', '/etc/mysql/my.cnf'],
   }
   ```

---

### **Post-Migration Phase**

#### 9. **Automate Post-Migration Testing:**
   - Use Puppet integrated with monitoring tools like **Nagios** or **Zabbix** to automatically test all services post-upgrade.

   **Puppet Manifest:**
   ```puppet
   exec { 'post_migration_tests':
     command => '/usr/local/bin/post_migration_tests.sh',
     path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin',
   }
   ```

#### 10. **Monitor & Fix Broken Sites**
   - Automate monitoring of all client websites for broken configurations and auto-fix common issues.

   **Puppet Manifest:**
   ```puppet
   exec { 'fix_broken_sites':
     command => '/usr/local/bin/fix_broken_sites.sh',
     path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin',
   }
   ```

#### 11. **Notify Teams & Customers:**
   - Once the post-migration tests are complete, send automatic notifications to teams and customers.

   **Puppet Manifest:**
   ```puppet
   exec { 'send_post_migration_notifications':
     command => '/usr/local/bin/send_post_migration_notifications.sh',
     path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin',
   }
   ```

#### 12. **Re-enable Customer Signups & Services:**
   - Automate the process to remove maintenance banners and restore customer signups.

   **Puppet Manifest:**
   ```puppet
   exec { 'enable_signups':
     command => '/usr/local/bin/enable_signups.sh',
     path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin',
   }

   file { '/usr/local/cpanel/banner':
     ensure => absent,
   }
   ```

### **Post-Upgrade Tasks & Comparison**

#### **Automated CloudLinux Comparison:**
   - After the upgrade, run performance and security checks to compare **CloudLinux 6** and **CloudLinux 8** environments.

   **Puppet Manifest:**
   ```puppet
   exec { 'compare_cl_versions':
     command => '/usr/local/bin/compare_cl_versions.sh',
     path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin',
   }
   ```

---

### **Migration Calendar**

- **8 Days Before Migration:**
  - Disable signups to the old server using automated scripts.
  - Notify product and CS teams via automated notifications.

- **7 Days Before Migration:**
  - Generate variables and enable the **cPanel banner** using Puppet.

- **2 Days Before Migration:**
  - Automate system audit, consistency checks, and database repairs.
  - Automate backup creation and synchronization.

- **2 Hours Before Migration:**
  - Automate final sync of content and send customer notifications.
